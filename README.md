# KuromuJS
A music axed discord bot that is clustered and that uses the Klasa framework (discord.js framework)

### Installation
Change `libs/config.js`'s values to the values you need.

Make sure you have build tools installed.

Install all the modules using `npm i --no-optional` (ref module will not build for node-opus so just don't build optional modules)

Install FFMPEG on your machine.

Have fun I guess!
